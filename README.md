  RFID based Intelligent Emergency vehicles Navigation Management. 
It is straight forward fact the use of embedded systems in traffic congestion had revolutionized the world that what we see today. The basic idea is to divide the road into 3 parts by making use of 2 redlines running from the 1/3rd  width gap from the two(2) side ends of the road and one white running in the middle of the road(the normal line that is currently seen in roads). we have a registered RFID tags on emergency vehicles and a RFID readers and the emergency red lights and alert sound system along the one side end of road. when an RFID reader detects an emergency vehicle with registered tag, it sends a signal to all the red lights and alert sound system that are at a predetermined or dynamically calculated distance ahead of current position of emergency vehicles. All the vehicles in road where the emergency red lights are active somehow must get themselves adjusted to road lying between redline and side ends of road, thus leaving road empty in the middle through which emergency vehicles can go. After the emergency vehicle passes public transport vehicles, cars ,bikes etc. can came back to through normal position.
